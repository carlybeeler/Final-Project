# Final Project
## Visualization Application and Repository
### Author(s): Carly Beeler, Emma Zelkind

## Section 1: Project Description
This repository is for the course project of MGT 4250 (Data Visualization and Storytelling) at Elon University
- [**Visualization Link**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carly.beeler/viz/CourseProject-MGT4250BeelerZelkind/TreeMap#1)
  The visualizations are on three seperate tabs when you access the link. (Named Line Graph 1, Line Graph 2, and TreeMap)
- **Project Question**: How does the pay gap change depending on the difference in hours worked?
- **Project Question Importance**: Understanding how the pay gap changes based on differences in hours worked is essential for dispelling misconceptions, informing policy decisions, and promoting fairness in the workplace. By examining this relationship, organizations can identify factors contributing to the gap, implement targeted interventions, and ensure fair compensation for all employees regardless of their work schedule, fostering inclusive environments and equal opportunities for advancement. The data that we use not only includes men and women wage gap over time on average, but also includes their race. This can be insightful to see because although our main focus is women in the workplace, the data will tell us if women of different races get increasingly different treatment. We are choosing to focus on this question and dive deeper into the significance of this segment of the topic since it directly relates to the female experience at work based on pay. It is quantifiable and able to explore, and directly impacts us as women entering the workforce.


## Section 2: Data Description and Upload
- **Data Acquisition Instructions**: Our data can be downloaded from the website [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), linked here for you. Once on the website you can log in, and then access the data. Look up in the search bar "Gender Wage Gap in the USA (1973-2022)."
- ??  Explain the data types and descriptions of the columnsused in visualizations.
- **Data used**: [gender_wage_gap.csv](https://github.com/carlybeeler/Final-Project/files/15223189/gender_wage_gap.csv)


## Section 3: Interpreting Visualizations
- **Line Graph 1**:  Women in the workplace by pay overtime by race 
This line graph explores the number of women in the workforce over time, broken down into three racial categories. This visualization shows how overtime there has been an increase in women in the job market along each race (black, hispanic, and white). This graph starts to show a plato for Hispanic women in the workplace while black and white women have started to slightly decrease from 2020 to now. 
- **Line Graph 2**:  Women versus men overtime
This line graph shows the change of amount of pay of employees based on gender overtime. This helps answer our question since it shows that the male average was always above 20 and even reached to 40 recently, while women was above 10 but never reached 30. This shows that there is a $10 difference between the two genders.
- **TreeMap**:  Women average by year
This tree map allows for a visual representation of the data where the colors are associated with the women's average. This helps show that overtime there has been a gradual progression in the workforce of women entering it.


## Section 4: Discussion Summary 
- **Article found**: [Article Link](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_equalpay-cap.pdf)
- **Summary of the article**:
This report sheds light on the pressing issues confronting workers and their families, which have garnered significant attention in the media and spurred political action. Key topics include the gender wage gap, minimum wage, and expansions of paid leave. A focal point of the discussion revolves around the working hours and scheduling challenges faced by lower-wage, hourly workers, which have been exacerbated by the weak labor market in recent years. The increasing use of "just-in-time" scheduling software further complicates matters, leading to less predictable and unstable schedules, particularly in retail sales.

Workers, especially parents, students, and dual-job employees, face hardships due to unpredictable schedules, which hinder their ability to balance work with family and student life. Furthermore, hourly workers, who are more likely to be paid on an hourly basis, experience lower wages compared to nonhourly workers, even for the same occupations. This wage disparity is particularly pronounced for women, who often work fewer hours and prefer more predictable schedules.

The report highlights the role of hours in determining earnings, noting that while more hours of work in higher-income occupations are associated with greater earnings per hour, technological advances have weakened this relationship. High-income professional workers may receive a wage premium for working long hours, but lower-income workers face penalties for working fewer hours.

Original data analysis using the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups provides insights into wage disparities among low- to moderate-income workers. While the report does not propose solutions, it underscores the importance of understanding wage disparities to address the needs of the modern workforce.

- **Asking our question to ChatGPT**:
  The pay gap can change depending on the difference in hours worked in several ways:

Hourly Wage Gap: The pay gap between men and women may vary depending on whether they are paid on an hourly basis or receive a fixed salary. Hourly workers may experience a larger pay gap if they work fewer hours compared to their full-time counterparts, as their earnings are directly tied to the number of hours worked.
Penalty for Working Fewer Hours: For workers who work fewer than 40 hours per week, there may be a penalty in terms of hourly wage rate. This penalty tends to be more significant for lower-income workers. Both men and women who work fewer hours may experience a decrease in their hourly wage compared to those who work full-time hours.
Occupational Differences: The impact of hours worked on the pay gap can vary across different occupational groups. Some occupations may have a higher penalty for working fewer hours, while others may be less affected. For example, workers in technician roles who work fewer than 40 hours per week may be less likely to face a wage penalty compared to those in food service or sales roles.
Occupational Gender Disparities: The pay gap may also differ depending on the gender composition of different occupational groups. In some occupations, women may experience a larger pay gap when working fewer hours compared to men in the same occupation. This could be due to various factors such as occupational segregation, discrimination, and societal norms.
Overall, the pay gap changes depending on the difference in hours worked, with hourly wage rates, occupational differences, and gender disparities all playing significant roles. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing and mitigating the pay gap across different segments of the workforce.

- **Visualization Discussion**: Our visualizations overall coincide more with the article's summary rather than ChatGPT's response. While both had good answer's, the article was a lot more desciptive with data to back up its findings. Chatgpt gave more ideas of how the difference in hours would affect the paygap, but not exact details or evidence of where and when this was happening. The article we found also comes from a much more reliable source than generative AI.
